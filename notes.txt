Use json dict: key is hash of video file
{
    "hash_here" : {
        "tags": [...],
        "rating": 10,
        playcount: 1,
        skipcount: 0,
        date: timestamp,
        lastplayed: timestamp,
        *
    },
    ...
}

*: potentially also
list of counts, one count for each second of the video
(so can plot histogram of sections viewed)

also encrypt with zip command line
play by rating

to count as playcount: duration spent on video >= max(5, video_length)

when importing: dialogue with list of videos imported
buttons down the bottom like ImageTagger. Pressing any of the buttons will advance down the list
also with preview video area (just like ImageTagger)

playing:
qtablewidget
bar along bottom where you can add tags
search bar to filter by tag
